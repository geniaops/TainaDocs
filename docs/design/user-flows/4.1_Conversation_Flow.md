## Detailed Flow Steps

### 1. Initial Access and Connection

1. **User Access**
   - User navigates to the Voice AI UI web application
   - System displays landing page with welcome message in Spanish
   - UI shows "Iniciar Conversación" button prominently

2. **Conversation Initiation**
   - User clicks "Iniciar Conversación" button
   - System requests microphone permission if not previously granted
   - System establishes WebRTC connection with backend
   - UI transitions to conversation mode

3. **Connection Confirmation**
   - System displays connection status indicator
   - Visual feedback confirms successful connection
   - UI shows "Escuchando..." indicator with animated microphone icon

### 2. User Input and Processing

1. **Speech Input**
   - User speaks query in Spanish
   - System captures audio through WebRTC
   - UI displays visual feedback indicating audio is being received
   - Optional: Real-time volume visualization

2. **Speech Processing**
   - System sends audio to Deepgram API for transcription
   - UI displays "Procesando..." indicator
   - System applies language detection to confirm Spanish input
   - System performs noise filtering and enhancement if needed

3. **Transcription Display**
   - System displays transcribed text in UI
   - Text appears in a conversational bubble format
   - Transcription is marked as "Usuario:" to distinguish from system responses

### 3. Response Generation and Delivery

1. **Response Generation**
   - System processes transcription with LLM
   - System retrieves relevant information from knowledge base
   - System formulates response in Spanish
   - UI displays "Generando respuesta..." indicator

2. **Response Delivery**
   - System sends response text to ElevenLabs for TTS
   - Audio response plays through user's speakers
   - UI displays text response in conversation bubble
   - Response is marked as "Taína:" to distinguish from user input
   - Visual indicator shows when system is speaking

3. **Follow-up Prompting**
   - After response completion, system returns to listening mode
   - UI displays "¿Algo más en lo que pueda ayudarle?" prompt
   - System displays "Escuchando..." indicator again
   - Optional quick-action buttons appear for common follow-ups

### 4. Conversation Continuation or Completion

1. **Continuation**
   - If user speaks again, system returns to the Speech Input step
   - Context from previous exchanges is maintained
   - System adjusts responses based on conversation history

2. **Completion**
   - User indicates conversation completion (explicit statement or timeout)
   - System acknowledges end of conversation
   - UI displays conversation summary
   - System offers options for follow-up actions (e.g., email transcript, schedule appointment)

3. **Post-Conversation**
   - System saves conversation transcript for analytics
   - UI offers option to start new conversation
   - System provides feedback mechanism for conversation quality

## Alternative Flows

### Error Handling

1. **Connection Issues**
   - If WebRTC connection fails, UI displays error message
   - System offers reconnection option
   - User can retry connection
   - Fallback to text-only mode if audio connection cannot be established

2. **Speech Recognition Errors**
   - If transcription confidence is low, system requests clarification
   - UI displays "No pude entender bien. ¿Puede repetirlo?"
   - System may suggest possible interpretations
   - After multiple failures, system offers alternative input methods

3. **Knowledge Gaps**
   - If system cannot answer query with high confidence, it acknowledges limitation
   - UI displays "No tengo suficiente información sobre eso"
   - System offers to connect with human agent
   - System suggests related topics it can help with

4. **Technical Failures**
   - If any API service fails (Deepgram, OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
   - System implements graceful degradation
   - UI displays appropriate error message
   - System offers alternative methods to continue

### Special Cases

1. **Human Agent Transfer**
   - User requests human agent or system determines need for escalation
   - System confirms transfer request
   - UI displays "Conectando con un agente humano..."
   - System transfers conversation context to human agent interface
   - Human agent continues conversation with full history

2. **Multi-turn Clarification**
   - System needs additional information to answer query
   - UI displays specific questions to clarify user intent
   - System guides user through structured information gathering
   - Once sufficient information is collected, system provides comprehensive response

3. **Appointment Scheduling**
   - User requests to schedule appointment
   - System initiates appointment scheduling flow
   - UI displays available time slots
   - System confirms appointment details
   - System sends confirmation to user via preferred method

## UI Elements and Visual Feedback

   - Animated transitions between states
   - Progress indicators for longer processes
   - Clear signaling of system state changes

2. **Intuitive Signaling**
   - Color coding for different conversation states
   - Consistent iconography throughout interface
   - Visual cues that match audio cues
   - Attention-directing animations for important elements

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

### System Voice Characteristics

   - Confirmation phrases vary to sound natural
   - Examples: "Entiendo su pregunta sobre...", "Con respecto a su consulta sobre..."

2. **Information Delivery**
   - Structured from general to specific
   - Important information presented first
   - Complex information broken into digestible chunks
   - Follow-up offers for additional details

3. **Clarification Requests**
   - Polite phrasing when requesting clarification
   - Specific about what information is needed
