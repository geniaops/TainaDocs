## Container Descriptions

### 1. Voice AI UI (Frontend)

**Technology Stack**: Next.js, React, WebRTC Client SDK

**Description**: 
The Voice AI UI is a web-based application that provides the conversational interface for citizens. It captures audio from the user's microphone, streams it to the backend via WebRTC, and plays back the system's responses. The UI is entirely in Spanish, providing an accessible interface for Spanish-speaking citizens. The UI is adaptable to multiple deployment channels, including kiosks, web, mobile, and call center interfaces.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Provide an intuitive, conversational interface in Spanish
- Capture and stream audio from the user's microphone

- Support text input as an alternative to speech
- Display conversation history
- Adapt to different deployment channels

### 2. WebRTC Agent (Backend)

**Technology Stack**: Python, FastAPI, WebRTC Server SDK

**Description**:
The WebRTC Agent is the core backend component that processes audio streams, manages conversations, and coordinates with external services. It handles speech-to-text conversion, natural language processing, knowledge retrieval, and text-to-speech conversion. It also integrates with government systems to provide accurate and up-to-date information about government services.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Process incoming audio streams from citizens
- Perform Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- Convert speech to text using Speech-to-Text API
- Process natural language using Language Model API
- Retrieve relevant information from the Knowledge Base

- Stream audio responses back to citizens
- Manage conversation state and context
- Integrate with government systems
- Store interaction data for analysis

### 3. Knowledge Base

**Technology Stack**: Vector Database (LlamaIndex)

**Description**:
The Knowledge Base stores government service information, documents, and frequently asked questions in a vector format that enables semantic search. It is used by the WebRTC Agent to retrieve relevant information when responding to user queries.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Store government service information in vector format
- Enable semantic search based on query embeddings
- Provide relevant context for the language model
- Support multiple document types and formats
- Maintain metadata about documents for citation

### 4. WebRTC Server

**Technology Stack**: Go, WebRTC

**Description**:
The WebRTC Server manages WebRTC connections and audio streaming between the frontend and backend. It handles room creation, participant management, and media routing.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Create and manage WebRTC rooms
- Authenticate participants using JWT tokens
- Route audio streams between frontend and backend
- Manage data channels for metadata exchange
- Handle network traversal (ICE, STUN, TURN)
- Ensure low-latency audio communication

### 5. Admin Dashboard

**Technology Stack**: Next.js, React

**Description**:
The Admin Dashboard provides an interface for system administrators to configure the system, monitor its performance, and manage the knowledge base. It allows administrators to view logs, update system parameters, and add or modify content in the knowledge base. It also provides access to analytics and insights generated from citizen interaction data.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Securely store citizen interaction data
- Anonymize personal information
- Maintain data retention policies
- Support high-volume data ingestion
- Enable efficient data retrieval for analysis

### 7. Analytics Engine

**Technology Stack**: Python, ML Libraries

**Description**:
The Analytics Engine analyzes citizen interaction data to identify patterns, generate insights, and improve system responses. It uses machine learning techniques to understand citizen needs and predict service demands.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Analyze citizen interaction patterns
- Identify common queries and issues
- Generate insights for service improvement
- Predict service demands
- Provide recommendations for knowledge base updates
- Support data-driven decision making

### 8. Deployment Channels

**Technology Stack**: Various (Next.js, React, React Native)

**Description**:
The Deployment Channels provide access to the TAINA system through multiple interfaces, including physical kiosks, web portals, mobile apps, and call center systems. Each channel adapts the Voice AI UI to its specific environment while maintaining consistent functionality.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Provide access to TAINA through multiple channels
- Adapt the user interface to each channel's environment
- Ensure consistent functionality across all channels
- Support channel-specific features and constraints
