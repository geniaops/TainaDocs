## Deployment Environment Descriptions

### Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)

The TAINA Voice AI system is primarily deployed on AWS cloud infrastructure, with the following key components:

#### Frontend Region (us-east-1)

**Content Delivery Network (CloudFront)**
- Hosts static assets for the Voice AI UI
- Provides global low-latency access
- Implements caching for improved performance
- Enables HTTPS for secure content delivery

**Frontend Cluster (ECS Fargate)**
- Runs the Voice AI UI application containers
- Auto-scales based on demand
- Managed container orchestration
- Load balancing across multiple instances

**Admin Cluster (ECS Fargate)**
- Runs the Admin Dashboard application containers
- Isolated from frontend for security
- Restricted access through security groups
- Separate scaling policies for admin traffic

#### Backend Region (us-east-1)

**API Gateway**
- Provides public API endpoints
- Implements request throttling and quotas
- Handles API key validation
- Routes requests to appropriate services

**Backend Cluster (EKS Kubernetes)**
- Runs WebRTC Agent containers in pods
- Implements horizontal pod autoscaling
- Provides self-healing capabilities
- Enables rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments

**LiveKit Pods (Kubernetes)**
- Runs LiveKit Server containers
- Optimized for real-time communication
- Configured for low-latency networking
- Scaled independently from other backend services

**Database Cluster (Amazon RDS)**
- Vector Database (PostgreSQL with pgvector extension)
  - Stores document vectors for semantic search
  - Optimized for vector similarity queries
  - Configured with read replicas for scaling
  
- Metadata Database (PostgreSQL)
  - Stores system configuration and metadata
  - Manages user sessions and preferences
  - Tracks conversation history references
  - Maintains system audit logs

**Object Storage (Amazon S3)**
- Document Storage Bucket
  - Stores original government service documents
  - Versioning enabled for document history
  - Lifecycle policies for archiving
  
- Audio Storage Bucket
  - Stores conversation recordings (when enabled)
  - Implements retention policies
  - Encrypted at rest for security

### External Services

The system integrates with several external services:

**ElevenLabs API**
- Hosted by ElevenLabs
- Accessed via REST API
- Requires API key authentication
- Used for high-quality Spanish TTS

**Deepgram API**
- Hosted by Deepgram
- Accessed via REST API
- Requires API key authentication
- Used for Spanish speech recognition

**OpenAI API**
- Hosted by OpenAI
- Accessed via REST API
- Requires API key authentication
- Used for natural language processing

**Appointment Booking System**
- Hosted by government service provider
- Accessed via REST API
- Requires OAuth authentication
- Used for scheduling government service appointments

### Client Devices

**Web Browser**
- Runs on client devices (desktop, mobile)
- Supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Requires WebRTC support
- Requires microphone permissions

**Admin Browser**
- Runs on administrator devices
- Supported browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Requires secure network connection
- Enhanced security requirements

## Deployment Considerations

### Scalability

The deployment architecture is designed for scalability at multiple levels:

**Horizontal Scaling**
- WebRTC Agent pods scale horizontally based on CPU and memory metrics
- LiveKit Server pods scale based on active connection count
- Frontend containers scale based on request volume

**Vertical Scaling**
- Database instances can be upgraded to larger sizes as needed
- Kubernetes nodes can be provisioned with more resources

**Regional Scaling**
- Architecture supports multi-region deployment for global availability
- Content delivery network provides global edge caching

### High Availability

The system implements several high availability features:

**Multi-AZ Deployment**
- All critical components deployed across multiple availability zones
- Automatic failover for database instances
- Load balancing across healthy instances

**Self-Healing**
- Kubernetes health checks and automatic pod replacement
- ECS service auto-recovery
- RDS automated backups and point-in-time recovery

**Redundancy**
- Multiple instances of each service component
- Database read replicas for query distribution
- Redundant storage with cross-region replication

### Security

The deployment includes comprehensive security measures:

**Network Security**
- VPC isolation for backend services
- Security groups with least-privilege access
- Private subnets for databases and internal services
- WAF protection for public endpoints

**Data Security**
- Encryption in transit (TLS/HTTPS)
- Encryption at rest (S3, RDS)
- Key rotation policies
- Secure parameter storage (AWS Secrets Manager)

**Access Control**
- IAM roles with least privilege
- RBAC for Kubernetes resources
- Multi-factor authentication for admin access
- API key management and rotation

### Monitoring and Logging

The deployment includes robust monitoring and logging:

**Centralized Logging**
- CloudWatch Logs for application logs
- Structured logging format
- Log retention policies
- Log insights for analysis

**Monitoring**
- CloudWatch metrics for system performance
- Custom metrics for business KPIs
- Dashboards for system overview
- Alarms for critical thresholds

**Tracing**
- Distributed tracing across services
- Request ID propagation
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error tracking and correlation

## Deployment Variants

### Development Environment

- Simplified deployment on lower-cost infrastructure
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Mocked external services where appropriate
- Shared database instances

### Staging Environment

- Mirrors production architecture at smaller scale
- Full integration with external service test environments
- Automated deployment from CI/CD pipeline
- Data sanitization for testing

### Production Environment

- Full-scale deployment as described in the diagram
- Strict security controls
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing
- Performance optimization and tuning

## Deployment Process

The system is deployed using infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**
   - Terraform for cloud resources
   - Kubernetes manifests for container orchestration
   - CloudFormation for AWS-specific resources

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated testing of components
   - Container image building
   - Security scanning
   - Artifact versioning

3. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Automated deployment to development and staging
   - Manual approval for production deployment
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Automated rollback capability

4. **Operational Procedures**
   - Runbooks for common operations
   - Incident response plan
   - Regular disaster recovery testing
   - Performance benchmarking
